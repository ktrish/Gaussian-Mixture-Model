# Gaussian-Mixture-Model

Applied GMM using pure Python to the Old Faithful dataset (https://www.stat.cmu.edu/˜larry/all-of-statistics/=data/faithful.dat)
The initial values for mean(µ1,µ2,µ3) and covariance were given as follows:
For k = 3, µ1 = (4.0, 81), µ2 = (2.0, 57), µ3 = (4.0, 71), Σ1 = Σ2 = Σ3 = 1.30  13.98
                                                                          13.98 184.82
